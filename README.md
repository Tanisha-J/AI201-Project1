# Unit 1

## What This Does

A question-answering system over `campus_life`: 88 short student-written posts
about a fictional university's dining halls, dorms, courses, transit and admin
rules. You ask a plain-English question ("How late is the library open during
reading week?"), it retrieves the most relevant posts with a local embedding
model, refuses if nothing is close enough, and otherwise has Gemini answer
using only those posts, naming the file it used.

## Chunking Strategy

**Chunk size:** one whole post per chunk (posts over 800 characters would be split on paragraph breaks — none are)
**Overlap:** none

Every post is one short thought: they average 317 characters and the longest
(`housing_old_brewhouse.txt`) is 554. Splitting them would only separate a
building's name from its facts — "Laundry in Morrow House" from "$1.50 wash,
$1.25 dry" — and since seven laundry posts are otherwise word-for-word
identical, a chunk without the building name is useless. So
`chunker.py::split_documents` keeps each post whole (88 documents → 88
chunks), with a paragraph-boundary split as a safety net for anything over
`CHUNK_SIZE`. Overlap only matters when you cut, so there is none.

## Sample Chunks

<!-- Five chunks, pasted as text. Label each one and name the file it came from
     AND the function that produced it — the grader checks your code against
     what you claim here.

     `python app.py chunks -n 5` prints all three for you. Copy them straight
     across.

     Milestone 3. -->

**Chunk 1** — source: `admin_add_drop_deadline.txt#0` — produced by: `chunker.py::split_documents`

```
On the add/drop deadline

You can add a course through the end of the second week. Dropping is a longer window — through the end of week six — but a drop after week two shows as a W on your transcript. Nothing anywhere on the registrar's site says this plainly, and students find out from each other.
```

**Chunk 2** — source: `course_biol_160.txt#0` — produced by: `chunker.py::split_documents`

```
BIOL 160 Cell Biology

I lived here my sophomore year. Format is lecture three times a week with a weekly lab. Assessment: four unit tests and a cumulative final. Not curved.

Expect 9 to 11 hours a week, the heaviest first-year course by reputation.

The one piece of advice: the unit tests come fast, roughly every three weeks; falling behind once is very hard to recover from.
```

**Chunk 3** — source: `course_hist_118_workload.txt#0` — produced by: `chunker.py::split_documents`

```
Workload for HIST 118 Modern World History

People keep asking so: a lot of reading, about 120 pages a week, but no problem sets. That's real time, not optimistic time.

It's front-loaded — the first month is heavier than the rest, partly because you're learning the format.
```

**Chunk 4** — source: `dining_pellew_dining_hall_followup.txt#0` — produced by: `chunker.py::split_documents`

```
Re: Pellew Dining Hall

Adding to what people have said about Pellew Dining Hall. The wait figure of 12 to 18 minutes at peak matches what I've seen. If you're trying to eat between classes, go before 11:45 and it's a different building entirely.

Also worth saying: the furthest hall from anywhere, next to the athletics centre. Nobody tells you this at orientation.
```

**Chunk 5** — source: `housing_innisfree_hall.txt#0` — produced by: `chunker.py::split_documents`

```
Innisfree Hall — what it's actually like

Transferred in last year, so take this with a grain of salt. Built 1991, renovated 2022. Rooms are doubles arranged as pairs sharing one bathroom between two rooms.

The good: the shared-bathroom-between-two-rooms arrangement is the best compromise on campus.

The bad: no air conditioning, which matters for the first three weeks of September.

Laundry costs $1.75 wash, $1.75 dry, app-based. On noise: moderate; the building is L-shaped and the short wing is much quieter.
```

## Sample Answer

<!-- One complete question and answer, pasted as text, with the source line
     visible. Milestone 4. -->

**Question:** How much does it cost to use a dryer in Morrow House?

**Answer:** (`python app.py ask ...`, best distance 0.320, cutoff 0.6)

```
It costs $1.25 to use a dryer in Morrow House.

Source: housing_morrow_house.txt (also found in housing_morrow_house_laundry.txt)

Sources retrieved: housing_aldridge_hall_laundry.txt, housing_innisfree_hall_laundry.txt, housing_morrow_house.txt, housing_morrow_house_laundry.txt, housing_old_brewhouse_laundry.txt
```

**My relevance cutoff:** 0.6 (kept the default, because my own measurements put it in the middle of a clean gap)

<!-- The number you set in config.py, and how you got there.

     You ran five questions your corpus covers and the five in OUT_OF_SCOPE
     that it clearly doesn't, and wrote down the best distance for each. What
     did those two groups look like? Where was the gap? Put the actual numbers
     here — the table below wants all ten rows.

     Milestone 4. -->

The five in-corpus questions landed between 0.320 and 0.463; the five
out-of-corpus ones between 0.825 and 0.934. Nothing falls between 0.463 and
0.825, so any cutoff in that range separates them; 0.6 leaves ~0.14 of margin
above the worst in-corpus question and ~0.22 below the closest out-of-corpus one.

| Question | In corpus? | Best distance |
|---|---|---|
| How often does the campus shuttle run on weekends? | yes | 0.411 |
| How much does it cost to use a dryer in Morrow House? | yes | 0.320 |
| What is the last week you can withdraw from a course? | yes | 0.406 |
| How late is the library open during reading week? | yes | 0.427 |
| Is a cash meal cheaper at Halden Hall or Kestrel Commons? | yes | 0.463 |
| What is the capital of Mongolia? | no | 0.825 |
| How do I change the oil in a diesel engine? | no | 0.934 |
| Who won the 1994 World Cup? | no | 0.886 |
| What is the recommended dosage of ibuprofen for a headache? | no | 0.844 |
| How do I write a for loop in Rust? | no | 0.896 |

## How I Used AI

<!-- Two specific moments. For each: what you asked for, what came back, and
     what you changed about it.

     "I asked Claude to write the chunking function from my notes. It ignored
     the overlap, so I added that myself" is the level of detail we're after.
     "I used AI to help me code" is not.

     Milestone 5. -->

**1. Writing the questions and criteria.** I asked Claude (Claude Code) to
draft my five test questions and criteria 4 and 5 from the `campus_life`
documents. It read the whole corpus and deliberately picked questions with
traps — seven near-identical laundry posts, the drop vs. withdrawal deadlines,
seven noise posts that all say "library open until 2am". It also added an
`answer_in` field to each question so criterion 1 could be checked
mechanically instead of by my judgment. I reviewed them and committed them
before running anything.

**2. Chunking and the cutoff.** Claude suggested keeping each post as one
chunk rather than tuning the 800/120 numbers, because no post reaches 800
characters, and measured the ten best distances that set the cutoff. I kept
0.6 because the measured gap (0.463 → 0.825) showed it was already safe.

# Unit 2

<!-- These sections get ADDED to what's already above. Don't delete or rewrite
     unit 1 — the point is that someone can see what you said before you knew
     how it went. -->

## Run Log — Before

<!-- Your five criteria, three runs each. `python run_eval.py --label before`
     runs the questions, puts the OUT_OF_SCOPE ones through the gate, and
     writes it all into results/ for you. Targets come from criteria.md; the
     verdict column is your call.

     Criterion 3 is measured in one deterministic pass rather than three, so
     the same number goes in all three run columns. That's correct, not lazy.

     Milestone 1. -->

| Criterion | Target | Run 1 | Run 2 | Run 3 | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Retrieved chunk contains the answer | 4 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 2. Every answer names a source | 5 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 3. Gate stops out-of-corpus questions | 4 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 4. | | | | | |
| 5. | | | | | |

<!-- Underneath, paste the REAL output for each criterion from one of your
     runs — the actual text your system produced, not a description of it.
     Name the file and function that produced it. -->

## Verdicts

<!-- MET or MISSED for each of the five, against the target you wrote last
     unit — not a new one. Plus a sentence on how you decided. That sentence
     matters most where it was close.

     If your target said 4 of 5 and your runs came out 4, 3, 4, that's a MISS.
     The target has to hold, not show up occasionally.

     Milestone 2. -->

| # | Criterion | Verdict | How I decided |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 |  |  |  |
| 2 |  |  |  |
| 3 |  |  |  |
| 4 |  |  |  |
| 5 |  |  |  |

## Diagnoses

<!-- For each miss: which stage caused it, and how. The stage alone isn't
     enough — you need the mechanism.

     Not a diagnosis: "Question 3 didn't work."
     A diagnosis:     "Question 3 asks about laundry costs. The answer is in
                       one sentence that got split across two chunks, so
                       neither chunk on its own contains it."

     The five stages: loading → chunking → embedding → retrieval → generation.

     Look for a pattern. If three misses all ask about numbers, that's one
     problem, not three.

     Missed nothing? Say so, then say honestly whether your targets were set
     low, and which one you'd tighten and to what.

     Milestone 3. -->

## The Improvement

**What I changed:**

**Why I picked it:**

<!-- Connect it to a specific diagnosis above in one sentence. If you can't,
     you picked a fix because it sounded impressive. -->

### Run Log — After

<!-- Same format, same five criteria, three runs each.
     `python run_eval.py --label after` -->

| Criterion | Target | Run 1 | Run 2 | Run 3 | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Retrieved chunk contains the answer | 4 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 2. Every answer names a source | 5 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 3. Gate stops out-of-corpus questions | 4 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 4. | | | | | |
| 5. | | | | | |

**Did it help?**

<!-- Say plainly whether it did, and how you know. If it made things worse,
     say that — a change that backfired, honestly reported, earns full credit
     and is more interesting than one that worked. What matters is that you can
     tell.

     Milestone 4. -->

## What's Still Broken

<!-- For each criterion still missed after your fix: what you'd do about it,
     and why you stopped where you did.

     "I ran out of time" is fine if it's true. Pretending nothing is left is
     not.

     Milestone 5. -->

## What I'd Do Differently

<!-- Knowing what you know now — which of your five criteria would you write
     differently, and why?

     Milestone 5. -->
